# \langle B \vert O \vert G \rangle
I hold a Ph.D. in Physics, with a specialization in Nanophysics from Université de Grenoble Alpes, France (2023), a master's in physics (2020), and a major in Physics (2018), both from the University of São Paulo, Brazil. 

With a robust technical background encompassing expertise in mathematics, statistics, and physics, I specialize in theoretical modeling for quantum technology-driven experiments.

Eager to transition to an industry career, my interests extend beyond quantum technologies to include machine learning and real-world data modeling. My passion for data storytelling drives my goal to apply cultivated Machine Learning techniques, gained through coursework and mentorship programs, to offer practical solutions to real-world challenges. Additionally, I'm open to roles that drive advancements in quantum technologies within the industry.

Proficiencies: Mathematical modeling, Data Analysis, Data Visualization, Data Treatment, Data Storytelling, Management, Outreach, Python, Mathematica.

Areas of Interest: Quantum Information Theory, Quantum Technologies, Quantum Thermodynamics, Machine Learning, Data Science
