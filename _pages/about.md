I am Bruno Ortega Goes, currently working as an Algorithm Engineer in the R&D team at Applied Materials. I am also a trained theoretical physicist with contributions in the fields of quantum thermodynamics and quantum technologies. Check out my publications page and/or my Google Scholar.

I hold a Ph.D. in Physics with a specialization in Nanophysics from Université de Grenoble Alpes, France (2023), as well as a Master’s (2020) and Bachelor’s (2018) in Physics from the University of São Paulo, Brazil.

I like to describe myself as a 'quantum engineer' because I leverage the knowledge and methodologies I developed during my research in quantum physics to create solutions for timely and real-world contemporary challenges.

At Applied Materials, I develop algorithms for software that analyzes Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) images, leveraging my knowledge and continually learning more about semiconductor physics, software development, mathematical methods, and machine and deep learning.

For further information about my academic and professional experiences, you can check my transcripts, CV, résumé, and LinkedIn profile.
