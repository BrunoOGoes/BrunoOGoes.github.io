Hello, I’m Bruno, a Brazilian scientist turned algorithm engineer at [Applied Materials France](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/eu/en/about/europe-overview/france-overview.html) (officially, though, I’m a consultant at [Lennatech](https://www.lennatech.com/)), who is trying to balance the urgency of client requests and the development of solutions with the tools at hand for timely, pragmatic problems posed in the company with thoroughly innovative, robust, and elegant solutions based on academic-style research. In short, a battle between an engineer and a fundamental scientist mindset. If you are reading this, you may be interested in details about my professional journey that led to this curious situation—let’s get into that from bottom to top.

### Before research: undergraduate studies
Concerning the scientist part, I’m someone who has an interest in a diverse set of topics, ranging from history, geopolitics, and linguistics to mathematics, physics, and astronomy. I decided to pursue a bachelor's in Physics at the Institute of Physics of the University of São Paulo, [IFUSP](http://portal.if.usp.br/ifusp/).

During my [4-year undergraduate studies](../files/undergrad_record.pdf), I fell in love with two subjects: quantum and statistical mechanics. The latter, in particular, because it is a neat application of probability theory using the laws of physics and clearly touches all subjects of physics. Of course, the separation between mechanics, thermodynamics, etc., is only pedagogical, but here there was no way of talking about something without making connections with other areas. Besides, the reasoning and methods can be easily imported to other areas—after all, it is all based on probability, the stem framework of mathematics. 

This love for quantum mechanics and statistical mechanics led me to pursue a master's in physics at the graduate program of the same institute. I obtained funding from [CNPq](https://www.gov.br/cnpq/pt-br) and joined Professor Gabriel Landi’s group, [Quantum Thermodynamics and Quantum Transport (QT2)](https://www.pas.rochester.edu/~gtlandi/), where I wrote a thesis in quantum thermodynamics, a perfect union of my two favorite subjects in an emerging field of research.

### Masters in physics: first research experience

During the [2-years of my master's](../files/graduate_record.pdf) in QT2, I succeeded in developing a theoretical framework to assess the entropy production rate for driven-dissipative quantum systems undergoing phase transitions. 

To explain shortly, “driven-dissipative” refers to the way its dynamics are modeled. It has one contribution from something that “pushes” or “drives” the system, conserving energy (unitary dynamics in the jargon of quantum mechanics), and another contribution that is “dissipative,” meaning it induces energy loss in the system, hence irreversibility. 

Phase transitions are observed daily when we boil water—the temperature increase makes the liquid water turn into vapor. The systems I focused on were mainly at zero temperature, and since thermal fluctuations are out of the game, only quantum fluctuations play a role. These “driven-dissipative phase transitions” were experimentally observed, but there was a theoretical gap in assessing entropy production—a measure of the irreversibility of some phenomena—in these kinds of systems. 

During this period, I participated in several international conferences where I presented posters, and by the end of my master's, I received an invitation to visit the former group of Professor Henrique Solano, qutis, at the Universidad del País Vasco in Spain—my first professional experience in an international research group (just before COVID-19 pandemics outbreak). 

The work developed during these years were published in prestigious peer-reviewed physics journals: two in [Physical Review Research](https://journals.aps.org/prresearch/about) and one in [Physical Review A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/about) (you can access them via my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hq4mgYkAAAAJ&hl=en)), along with my master thesis entitled [Wehrl entropy production theory for non-equilibrium quantum systems](https://www.teses.usp.br/teses/disponiveis/43/43134/tde-07052020-121421/en.php). By the way, during this period, I also worked as a tutor for undergraduate and graduate classes. That was an enriching experience as I like to be constantly reviewing, discussing, and learning from discussions and questions posed by people who are learning a subject for the first time.

### PhD in nanophysics: getting closer to experiments

By the time I was finishing my master's, I was looking for opportunities that would allow me to have a closer collaboration with experimentalists. This led me to change countries and pursue my PhD in Grenoble, France, in the [Quantum Energy Team](https://quantum-energy-team.cnrs.fr/) ($\vert QET \rangle$) led by Professor Alexia Auffèves as an Early Stage Researcher (ESR) in the [QUDOT-TECH](https://qudot-tech.cea.fr/) project, an EU Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation [Marie Curie Programme](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/). 

During my three PhD years, I worked mainly on developing analytical solutions and writing computer simulations for spin-photon interfaces. I worked in close collaboration with the [C2N group](https://goss.c2n.universite-paris-saclay.fr/en/members/loic-lanco-2/), focusing on problems of how to optimally imprint and extract (measure) spin information based on light-matter interactions, as well as how to observe and build non-Gaussian states of light—all with insights from top experimentalists designing state-of-the-art experiments. All these fundamental problems find applications in optical-based quantum computing platforms. 

During this period, I got the chance to visit different groups in DTU and Neils Bohr institute in Denmark, Cambridge in England, and C2N in Paris, gaining a broader view of the field, presenting posters and giving talks. This allowed me to interact and learn with world leading physicists. The works I collaborated with during these years were published in prestigious peer-reviewed physics journals: one in [Quantum journal](https://quantum-journal.org/about/),  one in [Physical Review A](https://journals.aps.org/pra/about), and one in [Nature nanotechnology](https://www.nature.com/nnano/journal-impact) (again, you can access them via my [google scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=Hq4mgYkAAAAJ&hl=en)), along with my PhD thesis entitled [Exactly modeling the unitary dynamics of quantum interfaces with collision models](https://theses.hal.science/tel-04536539/).

### After academia: transitioning to the private sector

By the end of my PhD, I developed a deep interest in machine learning and deep learning. After almost 10 years in academia studying and contributing to the development of theoretical knowledge in quantum technologies, I decided it was about time to search for something challenging where I could leverage my coding, analytical, and research skills, along with my interest in artificial intelligence, to provide short-term, client-industry solutions. 

To make a smooth transition, I joined a [Serasa Experian Data Lab](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/serasa-experian-datalab/posts/?feedView=all) [mentorship program](../files/DataLab_Certificado-Mentoria_Bruno.pdf). My mentor, Carlo, provided me a [solid training in data science and machine learning](https://vitaliset.github.io/tutoring-guideline/), along with tips to successfully migrate to the private sector. 

Finally, just after defending my thesis I got the opportunity to join [Applied Materials](https://www.appliedmaterials.com/il/en/about/israel-overview.html) to work as an algorithm engineer. Since them, I'm constantly being challenged and learning while contributing to the development of the semiconductor industry with state-of-the-art algorithms for contour-based metrological solutions.

### Outside 9-5

Outside of work, I kickstart my day at the gym before heading into the office. After work, you’ll find me playing bass, guitar, or drums—either at home or in a studio. Evenings are for chilling, whether that means experimenting in the kitchen (Brazilian recipes with a French touch), swimming, learning a new language (currently Esperanto), or reading a classic novel. Some of my favorite authors include Gabriel Garcia Marquez, José Saramago, Machado de Assis, Franz Kafka, and Dostoyevski.
