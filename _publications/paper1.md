title: "Quantum features of entropy production in driven-dissipative transitions"
collection: publications
permalink: 10.1103/PhysRevResearch.2.013136
excerpt: 'The physics of driven-dissipative transitions is currently a topic of great interest, particularly in quantum
optical systems. These transitions occur in systems kept out of equilibrium and are therefore characterized
by a finite entropy production rate. However, very little is known about how the entropy production behaves
around criticality, and all of it is restricted to classical systems. Using quantum phase-space methods, we put
forth a framework that allows for the complete characterization of the entropy production in driven-dissipative
transitions. Our framework is tailored specifically to describe photon loss dissipation, which is effectively a
zero-temperature process for which the standard theory of entropy production breaks down. As an application,
we study the open Dicke and Kerr models, which present continuous and discontinuous transitions, respectively.
We find that the entropy production naturally splits into two contributions. One matches the behavior observed
in classical systems. The other diverges at the critical point.'
