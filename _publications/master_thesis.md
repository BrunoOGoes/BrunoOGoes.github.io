excerpt: 'The physics of systems out of equilibrium is a topic of great interest, mainly due to the possibility of exploring phenomena that can not be observed in equilibrium systems. Driven-dissipative phase transitions open the opportunity of studying phases with no classical counterparts, and these can be experimentally realized in quantum optical platforms. Since these transitions occur in systems kept out of equilibrium, they are characterized by a finite entropy production rate. However, due to technical difficulties regarding the zero temperature limit and the non-gaussianity of such models, very little is known about how entropy production behaves around criticality. Using a quantum phase-space method, based on the Husimi Q-function, we put forth a framework that allows for the complete characterization of the entropy production in driven-dissipative transitions. This new theoretical framework is tailored specifically to describe photon loss dissipation, which is effectively a zero temperature process for which the standard theory of entropy production breaks down. It makes no assumptions about Gaussianity about the model or the state. It works for both, steady-states as well as the dynamics and as an application, we study both situations in the paradigmatic driven-dissipative Kerr model, which presents a discontinuous phase transition. For general driven-dissipative critical systems, where one can define a thermodynamic limit, we find that the entropy production rate and flux naturally split into two contributions: an extensive one and a contribution due to quantum fluctuations only. Moreover, we identify a contribution to the entropy production due to unitary dynamics, and we find that the behavior of this contribution at the non-equilibrium steady-state (NESS) matches the behavior of entropy production rate observed in classical systems. The quantum contributions are found to diverge at the critical point.'
