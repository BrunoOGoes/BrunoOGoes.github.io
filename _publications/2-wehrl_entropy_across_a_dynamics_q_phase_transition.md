title: "Wehrl entropy production rate across a dynamical quantum phase transition"

excerpt: 'The quench dynamics of many-body quantum systems may exhibit nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt echo,
a phenomenon known as dynamical phase transition (DPT). Despite considerable research into the underlying
mechanisms behind this phenomenon, several open questions still remain. Motivated by this, we put forth a
detailed study of DPTs from the perspective of quantum phase space and entropy production, a key concept in
thermodynamics. We focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and use spin-coherent states to construct the
corresponding Husimi-Q quasiprobability distribution. The entropy of the Q function, known as Wehrl entropy,
provides a measure of the coarse-grained dynamics of the system and, therefore, evolves nontrivially even
for closed systems. We show that critical quenches lead to a quasimonotonic growth of the Wehrl entropy in
time, combined with small oscillations. The former reflects the information scrambling characteristic of these
transitions and serves as a measure of entropy production. On the other hand, the small oscillations imply
negative entropy production rates and therefore signal the recurrences of the Loschmidt echo. Finally, we also
study a Gaussification of the model based on a modified Holstein-Primakoff approximation. This allows us to
identify the relative contribution of the low-energy sector to the emergence of DPTs. The results presented in
this article are relevant not only from the dynamical quantum phase transition perspective but also for the field
of quantum thermodynamics, since they point out that the Wehrl entropy can be used as a viable measure of
entropy production.'

The quench dynamics of many-body quantum systems may exhibit nonanalyticities in the Loschmidt echo,
a phenomenon known as dynamical phase transition (DPT). Despite considerable research into the underlying
mechanisms behind this phenomenon, several open questions still remain. Motivated by this, we put forth a
detailed study of DPTs from the perspective of quantum phase space and entropy production, a key concept in
thermodynamics. We focus on the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model and use spin-coherent states to construct the
corresponding Husimi$-Q$ quasiprobability distribution. The entropy of the Q function, known as Wehrl entropy,
provides a measure of the coarse-grained dynamics of the system and, therefore, evolves nontrivially even
for closed systems. We show that critical quenches lead to a quasimonotonic growth of the Wehrl entropy in
