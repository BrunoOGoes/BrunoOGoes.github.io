#### Research Question:

    How do quantum contextuality effects, such as anomalous weak values and Wigner function negativity, manifest in the energetics of a single-qubit gate driven by a coherent field in a waveguide?

#### Theoretical tools:

    Utilized a collision model to describe the joint dynamics of the qubit and field. Combined heterodyne detection with postselection to study the field’s weak values and quasiprobability distributions, including the conditional Husimi-Q and Wigner functions.

#### Key Results:

    * Demonstrated that the field's weak values, derived from the conditional Husimi-Q function, exhibit anomalous behavior in energy variations.
    * Showed that Wigner function negativity and anomalous weak values occur simultaneously for specific gate angles.

#### Implications:
Reveals a deeper connection between quantum contextuality and the energy dynamics of qubit gates, providing insights for experimental setups like superconducting circuits and enhancing understanding of energy correlations in quantum systems.
