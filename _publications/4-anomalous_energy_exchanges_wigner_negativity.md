excerpt: 'Anomalous weak values and the Wigner function's negativity are well-known witnesses of quantum contextuality. We show that these effects occur when analyzing the energetics of a single-qubit gate generated by a resonant coherent field traveling in a waveguide. The buildup of correlations between the qubit and the field is responsible for bounds on the gate fidelity, but also for a nontrivial energy balance recently observed in a superconducting setup. In the experimental scheme, the field is continuously monitored through heterodyne detection and then postselected over the outcomes of a final qubit's measurement. The postselected data can be interpreted as the field's weak values and can show anomalous values in the variation of the field's energy. We model the joint system dynamics with a collision model, gaining access to the qubit-field entangled state at any time. We find an analytical expression of the quasiprobability distribution of the postselected heterodyne signal, i.e., the conditional Husimi-Q function. The latter grants access to all the field's weak values: we use it to obtain that of the field's energy change and display its anomalous behavior. Finally, we derive the field's conditional Wigner function and show that anomalous weak values and Wigner function negativities arise for the same values of the gate's angle.'

#### Research Question:

    How do quantum contextuality effects, such as anomalous weak values and Wigner function negativity, manifest in the energetics of a single-qubit gate driven by a coherent field in a waveguide?

#### Theoretical tools:

    Utilized a collision model to describe the joint dynamics of the qubit and field. Combined heterodyne detection with postselection to study the field’s weak values and quasiprobability distributions, including the conditional Husimi-Q and Wigner functions.

#### Key Results:

    * Demonstrated that the field's weak values, derived from the conditional Husimi-Q function, exhibit anomalous behavior in energy variations.
    * Showed that Wigner function negativity and anomalous weak values occur simultaneously for specific gate angles.

#### Implications:
Reveals a deeper connection between quantum contextuality and the energy dynamics of qubit gates, providing insights for experimental setups like superconducting circuits and enhancing understanding of energy correlations in quantum systems.
